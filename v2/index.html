            <p>
              Hemorrhagic shock happens when a person loses so much blood that the
              heart can’t pump enough to keep the brain and vital organs alive.
              Without rapid intervention—stopping the bleeding and restoring
              circulation—the body begins to shut down in minutes.

              Why It Is the Leading Cause of Preventable Battlefield Death
            </h2>
            <p>
              On today’s battlefield, most deaths occur before the casualty reaches a
              surgeon. When blood loss is severe:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bleeding can be internal and invisible.</li>
              <li>Clots break apart during movement, flight, or stress.</li>
              <li>Transfusion may only temporarily stabilize the patient.</li>
              <li>Shock can return suddenly during MEDEVAC or early surgery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight">
              Because of these challenges, the vast majority of potentially survivable
              combat deaths are caused by uncontrolled hemorrhage.

          150 YEARS OF KNOWING THE PROBLEM. STILL NO DEFINITIVE SOLUTION.
        </h2>
        <p>
          From the American Civil War to Iraq and Afghanistan, battlefield surgeons
          have known the same truth: uncontrolled bleeding kills more Soldiers
          than any other battlefield injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite major advances in tourniquets, blood products, damage-control
          surgery, and rapid evacuation, hemorrhagic shock remains an unsolved
          problem—on the battlefield, in the ambulance, and in trauma centers
          around the world.

        <h2 class="section-title">
          SHOCK EVOLVES IN MINUTES. MOST RESEARCH MOVES IN YEARS.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Conventional medical research relies on slow, linear clinical trials that
          are not designed for the chaos and ethical constraints of battlefield
          trauma:
        </p>
        <ul class="two-column-list">
          <li>They cannot ethically expose humans to life-threatening shock.</li>
          <li>They can’t fully simulate battlefield or austere conditions.</li>
          <li>They require more standardized data than trauma patients can safely provide.</li>
          <li>They take years to produce results, while shock evolves in minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight">
          The result: modern medicine still lacks a validated, real-time model to
          predict, diagnose, and treat hemorrhagic shock in its earliest—and most
          critical—moments.
