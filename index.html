        OPERATION LIFEBLOOD unites military medicine, first responders, trauma surgeons, and scientists
        in a time-bound, milestone-driven research organization focused on a single mission:
        turning hemorrhagic shock from a leading cause of preventable death into a survivable
        condition for warfighters and civilians.

      <h2>Mission &amp; Vision</h2>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p><strong>Service to those who serve — and everyone they protect.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to eliminate preventable deaths from trauma and hemorrhagic shock by advancing
        innovative research, developing field-ready treatments, and translating military medical
        breakthroughs into lifesaving solutions for warfighters, first responders, and trauma
        patients worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focus on the full continuum of care: from point of injury, through evacuation and
        resuscitation, to definitive treatment and recovery.
      </p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p><strong>A world where survivable shock is no longer fatal.</strong></p>
      <p>
        We envision a world where no soldier or civilian dies from survivable shock — where science,
        technology, training, and systems of care work together to deliver rapid, effective, and
        deployable solutions in any environment.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>

      <h3>The Urgency of Hemorrhagic Shock</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “Hemorrhage remains the leading cause of preventable death on the battlefield.”<br />
        — <strong>COL Brian Eastridge, MD, Joint Trauma System</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <strong>Hemorrhagic shock</strong> happens when a person loses so much blood that the heart
        can’t pump enough to keep the brain and vital organs alive. Without rapid intervention—
        stopping the bleeding and restoring circulation—the body begins to shut down in minutes.
      </p>

      <h3>Why It Is the Leading Cause of Preventable Battlefield Death</h3>
      <p>On today’s battlefield, most deaths occur before the casualty reaches a surgeon. When blood loss is severe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bleeding can be internal and invisible.</li>
        <li>Clots break apart during movement, flight, or stress.</li>
        <li>Transfusion may only temporarily stabilize the patient.</li>
        <li>Shock can return suddenly during MEDEVAC or early surgery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because of these challenges, the vast majority of potentially survivable combat deaths
        are caused by uncontrolled hemorrhage.
      </p>

      <h3>A Problem Recognized for Generations</h3>
      <p>
        From the American Civil War to Iraq and Afghanistan, battlefield surgeons have known the same truth:
        uncontrolled bleeding kills more Soldiers than any other battlefield injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite major advances in tourniquets, blood products, damage-control surgery, and rapid evacuation,
        hemorrhagic shock remains an unsolved problem — on the battlefield, in the ambulance, and in trauma
        centers around the world.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Traditional Research Hasn’t Solved It</h3>
      <p>Traditional clinical research is not designed for the speed, chaos, and ethical constraints of battlefield trauma:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It cannot ethically expose humans to life-threatening shock.</li>
        <li>It cannot fully simulate battlefield or austere conditions.</li>
        <li>It requires more standardized data than trauma patients can safely provide.</li>
        <li>It moves in years, while shock evolves in minutes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result: modern medicine still lacks a <strong>validated, real-time model</strong> to predict,
        diagnose, and treat hemorrhagic shock in its earliest — and most critical — moments.

    <section id="how-we-work">
      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <h3>A Functional Research Organization built for impact, not inertia.</h3>

      <p>
        Operation Lifeblood is structured as a <strong>Functional Research Organization (FRO)</strong>:
        a dedicated, non-profit entity with a single, ambitious, and time-bounded mission.
        We assemble a full-time technical and clinical team, align them around clear milestones,
        and measure progress in real-world outcomes rather than publications alone.
      </p>

      <h4>01 – Time-Bound Mission</h4>
      <p>
        A 5–7 year horizon to move hemorrhagic shock from unsolved challenge to a domain with deployable tools,
        validated models, and new standards of care.
      </p>

      <h4>02 – Integrated Team</h4>
      <p>
        Cardiac surgeons, trauma physicians, combat medics, data scientists, and engineers working together —
        without institutional walls — toward one mission.
      </p>

      <h4>03 – Milestone-Driven</h4>
      <p>
        Clear technical, translational, and clinical milestones: validated models, decision-support tools,
        new protocols, and demonstration projects across military and civilian settings.
      </p>

      <h4>04 – Public Good Focus</h4>
      <p>
        Data, models, and guidelines developed as shared infrastructure for militaries, EMS systems,
        trauma centers, and researchers worldwide.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="core-programs">
      <h2>Core Programs</h2>
      <h3>Five lines of effort, one mission.</h3>

      <h4>1. Cardiac Digital Twin for Hemorrhagic Shock</h4>
      <p>
        A first-of-its-kind, high-fidelity computational model of how the heart and circulatory system respond
        to blood loss — built using scientific machine learning, DoD trauma data, and advanced simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cardiac digital twin will enable medics and clinicians to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Predict shock <strong>before</strong> it becomes fatal.</li>
        <li>Test treatments safely <em>in silico</em>.</li>
        <li>Personalize resuscitation in real time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2. Translational Medicine for First Responders &amp; Civilian Trauma Care</h4>
      <p>
        Adapting battlefield-proven protocols, diagnostics, and resuscitation strategies to EMS,
        emergency departments, and trauma networks around the world — co-designed with frontline
        clinicians to fit real-world staffing, equipment, and training constraints.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Trauma Innovation Challenge Grants</h4>
      <p>
        Competitive grants that identify, de-risk, and accelerate bold ideas in shock reversal,
        resuscitation strategies, field diagnostics, and novel therapeutics. Successful concepts
        are integrated into the broader Lifeblood mission where they can scale and be evaluated.
      </p>

      <h4>4. Hemorrhagic Shock Data &amp; Collaboration Network</h4>
      <p>
        A secure, ethically governed data commons connecting military, EMS, trauma centers, and
        research labs focused on hemorrhagic shock — enabling shared models, shared evidence,
        and shared learning, while respecting operational security and privacy.
      </p>

      <h4>5. Advocacy &amp; Policy Engagement</h4>
      <p>
        Elevating hemorrhagic shock as a sustained funding and policy priority across defense,
        public health, and emergency-care systems, and aligning resources with the true scale of
        the problem.

      <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
      <h3>Military Medicine • First Responders • Trauma Medicine</h3>

      <h4>Military Medicine</h4>
      <p>
        We support warfighters and combat casualty care across the full continuum of operations —
        providing tools, models, and protocols that work in the most austere, resource-limited,
        and high-threat environments.
      </p>

      <h4>First Responders</h4>
      <p>
        We adapt military-grade shock-care innovations for EMS professionals, fire-rescue teams,
        and disaster response units, ensuring they have practical, rapid, and effective frameworks
        for recognizing and treating shock.
      </p>

      <h4>Trauma Medicine</h4>
      <p>
        We partner with trauma centers, critical care teams, and academic researchers to incorporate
        digital twins, data networks, and new protocols into daily practice — bridging the gap
        from research to bedside.
