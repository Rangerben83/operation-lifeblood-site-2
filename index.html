# Eliminating Preventable Deaths from  
Hemorrhagic Shock

OPERATION LIFEBLOOD unites military medicine, first responders, trauma surgeons, and scientists in a time-bound, milestone-driven research organization focused on a single mission: turning hemorrhagic shock from a leading cause of preventable death into a survivable condition for warfighters and civilians.

Hemorrhagic Shock  
Military & Civilian Trauma • Battlefield to ICU

## Mission

### Service to those who serve — and everyone they protect.

Our mission is to eliminate preventable deaths from trauma and hemorrhagic shock by advancing innovative research, developing field-ready treatments, and translating military medical breakthroughs into lifesaving solutions for warfighters, first responders, and trauma patients worldwide.

We focus on the full continuum of care: from point of injury, through evacuation and resuscitation, to definitive treatment and recovery.

## Vision

### A world where survivable shock is no longer fatal.

We envision a world where no soldier or civilian dies from survivable shock — where science, technology, training, and systems of care work together to deliver rapid, effective, and deployable solutions in any environment.

**Core Values**

- Service to Those Who Serve  
- Scientific Excellence  
- Operational Realism  
- Collaboration across Military & Civilian Systems  
- Integrity & Transparency  
- Innovation for Impact, not just publications  
- Global Relevance & Knowledge Sharing

## The Problem

### The Urgency of Hemorrhagic Shock

> “Hemorrhage remains the leading cause of preventable death on the battlefield.”  
> — **COL Brian Eastridge, MD, Joint Trauma System**

**Hemorrhagic shock** happens when a person loses so much blood that the heart can’t pump enough to keep the brain and vital organs alive. Without rapid intervention — stopping the bleeding and restoring circulation — the body begins to shut down in minutes.

### Why It Is the Leading Cause of Preventable Battlefield Death

On today’s battlefield, most deaths occur before the casualty reaches a surgeon. When blood loss is severe:

- Bleeding can be internal and invisible.  
- Clots break apart during movement, flight, or stress.  
- Transfusion may only temporarily stabilize the patient.  
- Shock can return suddenly during MEDEVAC or early surgery.

Because of these challenges, the vast majority of potentially survivable combat deaths are caused by uncontrolled hemorrhage.

### A Problem Recognized for Generations

From the American Civil War to Iraq and Afghanistan, battlefield surgeons have known the same truth: uncontrolled bleeding kills more Soldiers than any other battlefield injury.

Despite major advances in tourniquets, blood products, damage-control surgery, and rapid evacuation, hemorrhagic shock remains an unsolved problem — on the battlefield, in the ambulance, and in trauma centers around the world.

### Why Traditional Research Hasn’t Solved It

Traditional clinical research is not designed for the speed, chaos, and ethical constraints of battlefield trauma:

- It cannot ethically expose humans to life-threatening shock.  
- It cannot fully simulate battlefield or austere conditions.  
- It requires more standardized data than trauma patients can safely provide.  
- It moves in years, while shock evolves in minutes.

The result: modern medicine still lacks a **validated, real-time model** to predict, diagnose, and treat hemorrhagic shock in its earliest — and most critical — moments.

## How We Work

### A Functional Research Organization built for impact, not inertia.

Operation Lifeblood is structured as a **Functional Research Organization (FRO)**: a dedicated, non-profit entity with a single, ambitious, and time-bounded mission. We assemble a full-time technical and clinical team, align them around clear milestones, and measure progress in real-world outcomes rather than publications alone.

**01 – Time-Bound Mission**

A 5–7 year horizon to move hemorrhagic shock from unsolved challenge to a domain with deployable tools, validated models, and new standards of care.

**02 – Integrated Team**

Cardiac surgeons, trauma physicians, combat medics, data scientists, and engineers working together — without institutional walls — toward one mission.

**03 – Milestone-Driven**

Clear technical, translational, and clinical milestones: validated models, decision-support tools, new protocols, and demonstration projects across military and civilian settings.

**04 – Public Good Focus**

Data, models, and guidelines developed as shared infrastructure for militaries, EMS systems, trauma centers, and researchers worldwide.

## Core Programs

### Five lines of effort, one mission.

Operation Lifeblood’s work is organized into five mutually reinforcing programs spanning advanced modeling, translational medicine, innovation funding, data infrastructure, and policy.

#### 1. Cardiac Digital Twin for Hemorrhagic Shock

A first-of-its-kind, high-fidelity computational model of how the heart and circulatory system respond to blood loss — built using scientific machine learning, DoD trauma data, and advanced simulation.

This cardiac digital twin will enable medics and clinicians to:

- Predict shock **before** it becomes fatal.  
- Test treatments safely *in silico*.  
- Personalize resuscitation in real time.

#### 2. Translational Medicine for First Responders & Civilian Trauma Care

Adapting battlefield-proven protocols, diagnostics, and resuscitation strategies to EMS, emergency departments, and trauma networks around the world.

Co-designed with frontline clinicians to fit real-world staffing, equipment, and training constraints.

#### 3. Trauma Innovation Challenge Grants

Competitive grants that identify, de-risk, and accelerate bold ideas in shock reversal, resuscitation strategies, field diagnostics, and novel therapeutics.

Successful concepts are integrated into the broader Lifeblood mission where they can scale and be evaluated.

#### 4. Hemorrhagic Shock Data & Collaboration Network

A secure, ethically governed data commons connecting military, EMS, trauma centers, and research labs focused on hemorrhagic shock.

Enabling shared models, shared evidence, and shared learning, while respecting operational security and privacy.

#### 5. Advocacy & Policy Engagement

Elevating hemorrhagic shock as a sustained funding and policy priority across defense, public health, and emergency-care systems.

Working with Congress, veterans’ organizations, hospital systems, and international partners to align resources with the true scale of the problem.

## Who We Serve

### Military Medicine • First Responders • Trauma Medicine

**Military Medicine**

We support warfighters and combat casualty care across the full continuum of operations — providing tools, models, and protocols that work in the most austere, resource-limited, and high-threat environments.

**First Responders**

We adapt military-grade shock-care innovations for EMS professionals, fire-rescue teams, and disaster response units, ensuring they have practical, rapid, and effective frameworks for recognizing and treating shock.

**Trauma Medicine**

We partner with trauma centers, critical care teams, and academic researchers to incorporate digital twins, data networks, and new protocols into daily practice — bridging the gap from research to bedside.
